This plane uses WiFi UDP for video transmission, which results in high latency and packet losses. Im currently looking for alternatives regarding wireless protocol or improvements to this current code.
Perhaps i could start by switching to JPEG instead of using RGB565 directly.
I could also switch to RPI 2 model B V1.1 with the RPI camera, but then i would need some kind of wireless module that is compatible with esp32.

Thy poor and basic schematic.
